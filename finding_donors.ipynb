    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**1. ADABOOST ALGORITHM :** <br>\n",
    "   - This ensemble classifier is widely used in many different domains in the real world. One such use of this classifier is for image classification. Link : https://www.uni-obuda.hu/journal/Markoski_Ivankovic_Ratgeber_Pecev_Glusac_57.pdf. In this research paper, the Adaboost Algorithm is used in Basketball player detection using Decision Trees as weak classifiers.<br>\n",
    "   - The main advantages of AdaBoosting is that it only needs few weak classifiers to work on , i.e, the classifiers which are just passable are also sufficient for this algorithm. It doesn't have much tuning to be done, as it we have to set the number of rounds and the work can be integrated. Different situations in real world, need to be done in precise way ,i.e, at each and every stage of solving a problem different methods needed to be used, and this algorithms precisely fits the weaker algorithms at those stages while solving.<br>\n",
    "   - The disadvantage is that if the data to work is big data then the time taken to train this might be very expenive. This algorithm also is very sensitive to outliers and can easily be mislead if the data is not proper.<br>\n",
    "   - As AdaBoost algorithm is an ensemble method, it is fact that ensemble methods work best for binary classification of data and the data which we are working on is precisely on that mark.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE :** <br>\n",
    "  - There are many real world applications of support vector machines. Link : http://www.jatit.org/volumes/research-papers/Vol12No1/1Vol12No1.pdf. In this research work, svm is mainly used for classification of various types of data such as : Diabetes Data, Satellite Data, Shuttle Data etc.. which can be used for research purposes in various fields. Some of the various domains are : face recognition, bioinformatics etc..<br>\n",
    "  - One of the advantage of using svm classifier is that it uses kernel trick for classification, which makes our job easier by just tuning the features of the kernel. For the classification the svm uses the boundary for its use, and only considers the core points for its use, which are also know as support vecotrs which helps them in training the data.<br>\n",
    "  - The main weakness for the svm classifier is that it has many parameters to be set correctly for the model to work and if the data which the model is working is very large, then proper setting of the margin for the data consumes a lot of computational time.<br>\n",
    "  - Support vector machines is one of the best classifiers to use when the data is too random and polynomial in nature.So I believe this classifier may prove to be useful for this binary classification.<br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "**3. DECISION TREE :**<br>\n",
    "  - Crime is one of the major real world threat in any society or organisation. Predicting the type of crime before-hand helps us in majority of ways. Link : http://article.sciencepublishinggroup.com/pdf/10.11648.j.mlr.20170201.14.pdf. In this research paper, the decision tree classifier is used for predicting crimes at universities.<br>\n",
    "  - Decision trees generally require less data preparation before hand when using it. It is also easy to implement and can be easy to explain to fellow executives. Even if there is any non-linear relationship between the parameters, it wont affect the performance of the model.<br>\n",
    "  - The main disadvantage of decision tree is that even if there is small change in the data, there can be huge change in performance of the model and it often tends to be inaccurate.<br>\n",
    "  - As there are many features for this dataset, the decision tree may not perform as well as the above two classifiers mentioned. But as mentioned above, due to this high multi feature dataset, there may be many overlappings or relationships between the data. So using this classifier may prove to be good. "

    "**Answer: ** The three algorithms which I chose for the classification are : SVM, AdaBoost and DecisionTree. According to the above result, the best classifier among the three algorithms is the AdaBoost Algorithm. I declare this classifier to be the best classifier for this dataset because the Fscore of this classifier when 100 percent of the data is used is more than the other classifiers. The SVM classifier is also having high fscore, which is comparable to fscore of adaboost algorithm. But the time this model it takes to train is very high, almost close to 2mins, this is very expensive and can hinder faster predictions. Decision Tree Classifier seems to be performing exceptionally well in the training dataset but it is not working well in the case of testing dataset. This is the case of overfitting and we tend to avoid it. So, considering all these facts, AdaBoost Algorithm is best suited for this data."

    "**Answer: ** The model that I have chosen to train the dataset is AdaBoost Algorithm which is an ensemble method. My preference for is simply based on 2 factors. One is that this dataset requires binary classification, i.e, people are meant to be divided into two categories : ones who are earning more than 50K salary and the ones who are earning less than 50K salary. It is given fact that the ensemble methods works best for binary classification of data. Second, This model does have less probability of overfitting. To explain it in simple terms, This algorithm uses weak classifier, i.e, the classifier which perform just above the normal random model. It first trains the data on the weak classifier, then it iterates this process again. During this process, this model focuses more on the wrong things it has classiified in the first iteration and tries to correct its mistake in the second iteration. The mistakes it has done in the second iteration, it tries to corrrect them in the third iteration, which makes the model more efficient with increase in training. These two reasons make the model more suitable for the dataset given. The prediction also improves with more data given and can also be adjusted according to the users preference.<br>\n",
    "    To go a bit deeper into understanding the Adaboost model which I have for this dataset, lets learn how it actually trains the dataset. Lets assume, we are using only 100 samples to train, and the ensemble method uses a weak classifier to classify and lets just say that, we got 90 correct and 10 wrong. Lets say, the weight of each sample is 1, given the fact, we get correctly classified weight to be 90 and wrongly classified weight to be 10. The Adaboost classifier neutralizes this, by making error weight equal to correct weight. The points which have been misclassified will be given more weight for, so the error will increase, in this case each point's weight is increase by 9 times. So, the final error weight will be 90, which is equal to the correctly classified weight. This process is being done because, in the next iteration, the adaboost algorithm will focus more on these over weighted error point, reaching a better performance. This process is continued till we are satisfied or till the model may reach 100% accuracy. Final, it combines all the classification it has done in all the iterations, to produce a super model whose performance is increase drastically.\n",
    "    Finally, after training this model to this extent, the question comes, will this model predict more accurately? The answer is yes. Because the data which is given for prediction, will be mapped to this model and this model has already classified the 2 predictions into many regions with high accuracy. The region where the data falls in this model, will be the classification for this data."

Because these three features decide the total income the person truly earns after everything is calculated. But age and education-num are something which I didn't expect them to important. As per the above graph, we can conclude that age and education-num are important, because age matters alot, as they say \"experience comes from age\", maybe the people who have more age are earning more salary. I truly comply with these results, which are five most important features for the given dataset."

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
